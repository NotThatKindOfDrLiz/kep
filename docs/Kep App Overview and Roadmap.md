# Kep App Overview and Roadmap

---

## App Name: Kep

Kep is a Nostr-based, privacy-respecting app designed to help distributed, diverse teams co-create meeting agendas and enhance decision-making workflows. It centers user accessibility, async collaboration, and integration with decentralized intelligence tools.

---

## Purpose and Vision

Kep enables teams to:
- Submit and curate agenda items anonymously or pseudonymously
- Facilitate inclusive input from all participants, regardless of location or ability
- Organize, prioritize, and synthesize discussion topics
- Integrate into broader workflows for action tracking and decision support

By anchoring in the Nostr protocol and embracing decentralized infrastructure, Kep advances data sovereignty and collaborative intelligence while remaining lightweight and user-friendly.

## Core Users and Accessibility Considerations

Kep is designed with a wide range of users in mind, including:

- **Async teams** (across time zones, without shared meeting hours)
- **Multilingual users** (via optional translations)
- **Neurodivergent individuals** (with structured prompt options and simple UI)
- **Deaf and hard-of-hearing users** (support for video input, future ASL support)
- **Low-vision or blind users** (screen reader compatibility, voice-to-text submission)
- **Globally distributed teams** (timezone-localized UI and reminders)

Accessibility-first design choices include:
- Light/dark mode synced with system settings (user override available)
- High-contrast, accessible color palette and text scaling
- ARIA labels and keyboard navigability
